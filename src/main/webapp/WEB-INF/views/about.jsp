<h2>About me</h2>
</div>
<div>
Hi : My name is <b>Sabina Yasmin</b> and I am beginner Java programmer. I created this project to check my skill set and learn new skills regarding Java EE. I started my journey with programming exactly one year ago at the "programming" classes at IsDB-BISEW. Then I got to know complete basics, such as Primitive Data Types, what is a class, what is an object, what is an interface etc. One year ago I was complete novice, but I really fell in love with programming and started to work on this field and improve my skills. 
<br>
I am eagerly looking for my first real-life experience as a Java Programmer. If you can make my dream come true - feel free to contact me: <b><i>sabinayasmin34@gmail.com</i></b>
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
Sabina Yasmin
